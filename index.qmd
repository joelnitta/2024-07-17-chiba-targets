## Outline of today's workshop

- Introduction to {targets}

- Live coding

- Break

- More live coding

## Setup

- Local: Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and [targets](https://github.com/ropensci/targets)

- Cloud (only if you can't run R on your own computer): Sign in to the [Posit Cloud instance](https://posit.cloud/content/6064275) (requires account; free)

## Code of Conduct

- By participating in this workshop, you agree to abide by the [Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)

## About The Carpentries

- [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/about/) (since 1998) is an **open** workshop series for researchers to teach each other **best practices for research computing** as a **community**

- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) includes also [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) and [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/)

- This lesson is **in-development** (not an official workshop, yet)

## Why {targets}?

. . .

### To make your code more reproducible

## What is reproducibility?

. . .

> The ability for others (or your future self) to re-run your code and get the same results

. . .

- Not "yes" or "no"
- Reproducibility = **mindset**
- Many aspects
  - Computing environment
  - Data availability
  - **Code automation**

## Workflows in R

- **Which steps** need to be run **in what order**?

## Workflows in R

![](images/workflow_2.png){fig-alt="Hadley Wickham's data analysis workflow chart with icon showing part of it changed" width="100%" height="100%"}

- If **one part** of a workflow changes, **how does it affect other parts?**

- **How much of it do we need to re-run?**

## What is {targets}?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
- Automates workflow

- Only runs necessary steps

- Can run workflow steps in parallel (speeds up analysis)

- Provides proof that **results** are derived **from code**
